# Hello-World

Hey Everybody,

I've got red hair. I can code in vb.net, vb6, asp, aspx and pascal and C# if I can remember it anymore.
I am always looking for more to learn like python and java and other languages.  I know a little of both python from Ren'py, and Java from some javascript in some web pages. I know a little ruby from RPG Maker VX Ace. So integrating languages isn't difficult to me just putting them to good use.
