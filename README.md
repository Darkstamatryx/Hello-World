# Hello-World

Hey Everybody,

I've got red hair. I can code in vb.net, pascal if I can rembember back far enough and vb6 as well as asp.
I am always looking for more to learn.  Like python and jva and and other languages.  I know a little of both python from Ren'py, and Jave from some javascript in some web pages. I know a little ruby from RPG Maker VX Ace. So integrating languages isn't difficult to me just putting them to good use.
